## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed)

```{r}
library(readr)
demo_r_pjanaggr3_custom_3558281_linear <- read_csv("demo_r_pjanaggr3__custom_3558281_linear.csv")
View(demo_r_pjanaggr3_custom_3558281_linear)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
<- read_csv("demo_r_pjanaggr3__custom_3558281_linear.csv", 
    na = "NA")
View(demo_r_pjanaggr3_custom_3558281_linear)
```

```{r}
populationfile <- read_csv('demo_r_pjanaggr3.csv')
```

```{r}
populationdata <- populationfile %>%
  rename(Year = TIME_PERIOD, Population = OBS_VALUE, Country = geo)
```
